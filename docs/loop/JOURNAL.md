# Loop journal

Newest first. Each entry: task, need check, what was done, evidence (commands and
results), and what was learned or blocked.

## 2026-09-25 · T1.2 source inventory
- **Need check:** everything is time- and network-sensitive, so each source was tested live from this machine
  (curl / aiohttp WS) and limits were read from the official Binance docs on GitHub; CryptoPanic terms via search.
- **Done:** `docs/research/sources.md`. **Key finding:** `api/stream/fapi.binance.com`, Bybit, OKX and Coinbase
  are unreachable from dev, but the official market-data mirrors `data-api.binance.vision` and
  `wss://data-stream.binance.vision` work (a live bookTicker was received). Phase 2 can run locally on
  mirrors that physically can't trade. RSS x4, Fear & Greed, CoinGecko, mempool.space and Kraken futures
  are reachable. CryptoPanic has gone paid-only.
- **Escalations:** E6 (CryptoPanic/Reddit/Telegram-channel reading need owner decisions; VPS reachability of fapi).
- **Anti-slop:** the WS limits are documented for `stream.binance.com`, not the mirror, and are now labelled "assumed
  same". Removed an unverified claim about REST weight limits.
- **Evidence:** the reachability table is from commands run at the time of writing (in this iteration's log).

## 2026-09-25 · T1.1 fees and break-even
- **Need check:** fees are time-sensitive, so I searched. binance.com and developers.binance.com refuse connections
  from this machine (ECONNREFUSED); used the official API docs on GitHub (primary) plus secondary fee guides.
  The docs' BNB-discount examples contradict each other (0.25 vs 0.75), so the account's real rate is UNKNOWN until E1.
- **Done:** `research/07-breakeven.py` (tested, `tests/loop/test_breakeven.py`) and `docs/research/fees-and-breakeven.md`.
  Result: symmetric scalps at TP ≤ 0.3% need 74–90%+ win rates to break even, and 0.2% is near impossible.
  Viable zone: TP ≥ ~1%, asymmetric R, or maker entries. This constrains Phase 3 (score signals net of cost)
  and Phase 4 (targets ≥ 1%, and the fill model must price non-fill risk).
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/loop`: `10 passed`. The table is script output, not hand-typed.
- **Anti-slop:** no fee number is presented as this account's actual rate; the scenarios are labelled scenarios.

## 2026-09-25 · T0.9 test_forward uses a seeded DB
- **Need check:** none external; read `forward.advance` and `AllocationConfig`.
- **Done:** `test_wallet_cap_no_dead_entries` now uses the file's own `_seed_db` fixture and an explicit
  config ($10 wallet, $4 buys), and asserts the exact entries `[4, 4, 2]`. Before, it read the real
  `data/trading.db`: it failed off-VPS, and on an empty table every assertion passed vacuously.
- **Evidence:** `pytest tests/test_forward.py`: `4 passed`. **Mutation check:** deleting the wallet cap
  (`forward.py:75-76`) makes the test fail (`1 failed`), and the file was restored afterwards (`git status` shows only
  the test file). Full suite: `54 passed, 3 skipped, 10 errors`. **0 failures** (was 1).
- **Anti-slop:** the replaced test asserted `processed >= 0`, which is always true (test theater). The new one fails when the cap is broken.

## 2026-09-25 · T0.6 design for F4 (live_executor)
- **Need check:** read `live_executor.py` and `live_client.py`; confirmed both books use the same
  `config/live.env` account. No external facts needed.
- **Done:** `docs/loop/designs/T0.6.md`. The worst finding is not the 10% self-heal threshold: on exit,
  `manage()` sells the **entire free balance** of the coin, and its universe overlaps the live
  trend book's in the same wallet. If `LIVE_ENABLED` were restored, it would sell trend_follower's coins.
  It also invents a sell qty (`size/entry`) and exit prices (ticker `px`) while the real fill is available.
  Recommendation: **Option 0**, retire it (the owner removes the cron line). Option 1 is a fix via a shared
  `real_order_journal.py` used by both scripts.
- **Anti-slop self-review:** corrected `live_client.py` line refs (`privatePostOrder` at `:148`/`:115`),
  and noted that `place_market_*` bypasses ccxt's `create_order`, so the T0.3 `params` approach needs a
  raw `newClientOrderId` there.
- **Evidence:** docs only.

## 2026-09-25 · T0.5 design for F3 (real exits not recorded)
- **Need check:** who reads the real trend book, found by grep across `scripts/`. ccxt `fetch_my_trades` exists
  (`binance.py:8392`). No prod files needed for the design; confirming the lead needs E1.
- **Done:** `docs/loop/designs/T0.5.md`. The real book has **no closed-trade record**: a real sell
  writes nothing, a sub-minimum balance deletes the record, and `st.log` is the 53-symbol paper
  log. Yet `expectancy_vs_fee.py:101` labels that log "REAL $" and `fee_audit.py` prices it at a
  hardcoded $5 stake. Design: a `real.closed` list with fill-based values and `*_status` fields,
  UNKNOWN when missing, no deletions, trade-history reconstruction only when quantities reconcile.
- **Lead for work item 1:** the "live-record discrepancy" is plausibly real numbers being derived from
  the paper log. Added to E1 as the first thing to check.
- **New task:** T0.10 (readers stop calling the paper log real).
- **Anti-slop self-review:** verified the symbol counts by parsing the file (SYMS=53, REAL_SYMS=15) and
  corrected a line range (`fee_audit.py:97-115`).
- **Evidence:** docs only.

## 2026-09-25 · T0.4 design for F2 (stranded real position)
- **Need check:** ccxt exception classes and Binance error mapping, verified in the installed
  ccxt 4.5.73 (`InsufficientFunds` at `binance.py:2791`, `-2010` → `InvalidOrder` at `:2523`). No prod files needed.
- **Done:** `docs/loop/designs/T0.4.md`. A failed sell flips the paper flag first, so the exit is
  never retried, **the hard stop turns off** and the same coin can be bought again. Design: a
  real exit pass driven by `real.open`, `exit_pending` retries classified by exception,
  never holding a symbol twice, exits recorded from the fill price or `UNKNOWN`.
- **Anti-slop self-review:** the first draft said a blind retry after a client-side timeout
  would fail harmlessly with `InsufficientFunds`. That's false when the wallet holds other units
  of the coin (as in the DOGE incident). Replaced with a sell-side `clientOrderId` lookup
  before any retry.
- **Evidence:** docs only. The implementation is T8.1 (owner-gated).

## 2026-09-25 · T0.3 design for F1 (duplicate real buy)
- **Need check:** time-sensitive facts about Binance order IDs and ccxt behaviour, so I checked
  primary sources: [binance-spot-api-docs rest-api.md](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md)
  (`newClientOrderId` is unique only among OPEN orders; a filled one can be reused) and the
  installed ccxt 4.5.73 source. No prod files needed.
- **Done:** `docs/loop/designs/T0.3.md`. It found three paths to a duplicate buy, not one:
  (A) a kill between order and save, (B) a torn write that `load()` silently reads as an empty
  book, (C) overlapping cron runs with no lock. Design: atomic save, fail closed on a corrupt
  state file, a run lock, a write-ahead intent with a client order ID that is resolved at the
  next start, and a wallet-count cap. Entry price comes from the fill, otherwise `UNKNOWN`.
- **Anti-slop self-review:** fixed wrong ccxt line references (they pointed at
  `edit_spot_order_request`, not `create_order_request`), removed an ungrounded
  "exception escapes the loop" path (the loop catches at `:307`), removed speculation about
  Binance order retention, marked the $1 dust threshold and the VPS filesystem as owner-to-confirm,
  and added path C. The audit is recorded here instead of a separate `docs/local/audits` file, to
  keep this PR to one change.
- **Evidence:** docs only; nothing to execute. The implementation is T8.1 (owner-gated).

## 2026-09-25 · T0.2 tests/loop harness
- **Need check:** no external data or prod files; test-only code.
- **Done:** `tests/loop/conftest.py` with two autouse guards (no network unless
  `@pytest.mark.network`; importing any real-money module fails the test) and
  `test_loop_harness.py` (7 tests: interpreter is 3.12, `trading` importable, both guards fire).
- **Evidence:** `.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests/loop -q`: `7 passed in 0.07s`.
  Full suite with `--continue-on-collection-errors`: `1 failed, 53 passed, 3 skipped, 10 errors`;
  without this change: `1 failed, 46 passed, 3 skipped, 10 errors`. Same failure and errors,
  +7 passes. The existing suite is unaffected.
- **Learned:** a pre-existing failure, `test_forward.py::test_wallet_cap_no_dead_entries`,
  opens the real `data/trading.db`. Filed as T0.9 instead of bundling a fix.

## 2026-09-25 · T0.1 loop scaffolding
- **Need check:** no external data needed; facts come from the repo and this session's findings.
- **Done:** added LOOP (contract), ROADMAP, TASKS, ESCALATIONS, JOURNAL. Created the
  `loop/integration` branch from `origin/main` at `b0e8091`.
- **Evidence:** docs only; no code changed.
- **Known baseline:** CI is red on `main` (check-books hardcoded path; `trading.data` untracked).
  The loop's own tests go in `tests/loop/`.
