## E4 · Review the F1 and F2 fix designs (T0.3 PR #3, T0.4 PR #4)
`docs/loop/designs/T0.3.md` and `T0.4.md`. F2 is High: a failed sell currently leaves a real position with **no hard stop**. Both need your approval before T8.1 can implement it, plus two facts:

## E3 · CI fix touches a guard script (T0.8)
`check-books.py` hardcodes `/opt/trading-agent/data/book-counts-snapshot.json`, so CI
fails before pytest runs. Proposal: read the base path from an env var, defaulting to the
current path so prod behaviour is unchanged. It is on the no-touch list, so it needs a yes.
**Answer:**

## E2 · `src/trading/data/` exists only on the VPS (T0.7)
Please supply read-only copies of `/opt/trading-agent/src/trading/data/*.py` (code, no
credentials). They get committed with a `!src/trading/data/` gitignore exception.
**Answer:**

## E1 · Work item 1 (live-record discrepancy): snapshot request
Read-only: `data/trend-state.json`, `data/live-trades.json`, `data/fee-audit.json`,
`reports/signal-ledger.json`, the last ~500 lines of `logs/trend.log` plus every `ERR`/`record dropped`
line, `crontab -l`, wallet quantities for the 3 open coins, and whether `config/LIVE_ENABLED` exists.
